        Thank you for suggesting a new feature! Please provide as much detail as possible to help us understand your request.

      label: Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
      description: |
        A clear and concise description of what the problem is. For example: "I'm always frustrated when..."
      placeholder: |
        I'm always frustrated when I have to manually backup each router individually.
        It would be much better if I could schedule automatic backups for all routers at once.

      description: |
        A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
      placeholder: |
        I would like to be able to create backup schedules that can:
        - Run automatically at specified times
        - Apply to multiple routers at once
        - Support different backup types (full vs incremental)
        - Send email notifications when backups complete or fail

      description: |
        Are there any alternative solutions or features you've considered?
      placeholder: |
        I've considered using external cron jobs to trigger the API endpoints,
        but a built-in scheduler would be much more user-friendly and integrated.

        Add any other context, screenshots, or examples about the feature request here.

        This feature would be particularly useful for:
        - Enterprise environments with many routers
        - Remote management scenarios
        - Compliance requirements for regular backups

        please share them here. This is completely optional but very helpful!
      placeholder: |
        The scheduling system could be implemented using:
        - APScheduler for Python-based scheduling
        - A simple cron-like syntax for defining schedules
        - A web interface for managing schedules
        - Email notifications using smtplib
